# Minesweeper

This was a school project to code the game Minesweeper

All code was written by me Ryan Johnson

To run go to rjohnso6Minesweeper/bin/Debug
then run the rjohnso6Minesweeper application

This was made in Visual Studio. To look at and modify the source code, open in Visual Studio.

KNOWN ISSUES

1. The game will never spawn a mine onto the very first square you click. This was an intentional assignment requirement.
2. The top-leftmost square is also always safe in every game. This is NOT intentional, it is a bug.
3. If you use the game tab to end a game, the timer will continue counting your time spent playing when it should pause.
